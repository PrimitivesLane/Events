## The Foreseeable & Unavoidable War
This folder holds the presentation slides and videos from The **Foreseeable & Unavoidable War** event at ETHDevner.

This event is designed to discuss how recent milestones—such as Ulbricht Ross’s release after a long prison term and Julian Assange’s earlier freedom—have rekindled debates on technical neutrality. It explores the origins of the crypto spirit, its connection to today's dynamic crypto movement, and the core principles that define cypherpunk ideology, all while addressing the pressing question of how best to protect our digital freedoms amid the potentions threat of a new crypto war.
